Working with branches
---------------------

{: .-three-column}

### Creating

    git checkout -b $branchname
    git push origin $branchname --set-upstream

Creates a new branch locally then pushes it.

### Getting from remote

    git fetch origin
    git checkout --track origin/$branchname

Gets a branch in a remote.

### Delete local remote-tracking branches

    git remote prune origin

Deletes `origin/*` branches in your local copy. Doesn’t affect the remote.

### List existing branches

    git branch --list

Existing branches are listed. Current branch will be highlighted with an asterisk.

### List merged branches

    git branch -a --merged

List outdated branches that have been merged into the current one.

### Delete a local branch

    git branch -d $branchname

Deletes the branch only if the changes have been pushed and merged with remote.

### Delete branch forcefully

    git branch -D $branchname

    git branch -d $branchname

> Note: You can also use the -D flag which is synonymous with –delete –force instead of -d. This will delete the branch regardless of its merge status. Delete a branch irrespective of its merged status.

### Delete remote branch

    git push origin --delete :$branchname

Works for tags, too!

### Get current sha1

    git show-ref HEAD -s

### Reset branch and remove all changes

    git reset --hard

### Undo commits to a specific commit

    git reset --hard $commit_id

    # Now push to your branch
    git push --force
